This project involves the collaborative integration of services between Mandala Chain and the DJoin Kocek platform. This integration will be carried out by Baliola and DJoin. This project is a component of research and development efforts for the DJoin Kocek service, utilizing Mandala Chain technology. The integration will be based on API communication with a blockchain node.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.JS `22.12.0`** : A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js provides a rich library of modules that simplifies the development of web applications.
- **TypeScript `^5.1.3`** : A superset of JavaScript that allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

The project also uses some packages like:

- **Nest.JS `10.4.9`** : A framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
- **Ethers `^6.13.5`** : A complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
- **@litehex/node-vault `^1.0.2`** : A JavaScript/TypeScript library that helps app interact with Vault by HashiCorp and it acts as a bridge between your code and Vault.
